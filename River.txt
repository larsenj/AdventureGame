The river is still there, tauntung me with the promise of nearby escape.

I come to yet another opening in the underground complex. A vast roiling river 
of blackened ichor stretches before me, either end disappearing into the
darkeness. Just beyond the river I see a faint bit of light - sunlight! This is
the way out of this horrid place! I dare not try to swim across the putrid river,
but nearby on the bank sits small wooden raft. I try to push it but quickly 
realize it will not budge, regardless of my exertions. I notice a small empty can
on the boat.
~I have no use for the can and the raft canont be moved. Nothing is happening
here.
~Desperations gnaws at me, but still I dare not try swimming across these malignant
waters. I must try something else. Three paths are available to me.
1 - North
2 - South
3 - West
~Perhaps the can is intended for some form of payment. I could place the coin I
have in it, or I may try my luck elsewhere.
1 - Place the coin in the can.
2 - North
3 - South
4 - West
~I dig the copper coin out fo my pocket, it seems to adhere to my hand, but 
eventually I manage to drop it into the can. The boat rumbles and starts to move
of it's own volition into the river! I scramble aboard and graspe what edges I 
can as it slowly moves across the river. I briefly look into the waters then
quickly scruntch my eyes shut, telling myself that I did not see multitudes of
damned souls pleding for help.
~I placed the coin in the can. It rattles around, shoots out into the air, then 
falls into the river. I have the distinct impression that I must have missed 
something.
