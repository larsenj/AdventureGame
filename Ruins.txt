The passageway opens up a bit. There a walls, most of them cumbling and  largely
destoryed. I can only surmise that there was once a series of buildings here. This
is exactly the kind of thing my companions and I had come here to study. Oh the
archeological papers we could have written! But now I must forgo any hope of study
in favor of the mere act of staying alive. Or even sane, as all around these ruins
I hear whispers. Whispers just low enough that I cannot make out what they say,
though this may come as a mercy as I fear the things they would tell me.
