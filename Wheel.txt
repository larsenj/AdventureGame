I once again find myself in the room with the dial.
~
As the passageway opens I find myself in another cavern. The one differentiating
feature of this one is one of the sides is a smooth, straight wall. Definitely
not a natural formation, as these precise angles are not found normally in nature.
Also because there is a complex dial on the wall. I look more closely, and it seems
to be a mechanism comprised of an inner wheel and an outer one. There are identical
markings on the wheels, primitive drawings depicting what I can only guess are
a star, the sun, and the moon. I apply some pressure to them, and find that I can
rotate the wheels should I so desire.
~I can move the wheels, or try my luck elsewhere.
1 - Turn inner wheel counter-clockwise
2 - Turn inner wheel clockwise
3 - Turn outer wheel couter-clockwise
4 - Turn outer wheel clockwise
5 - North
6 - West
~The open passages remain so.
~With the extra open passages, I have more choices as to where to go.    
1 - North
2 - South
3 - East
4 - West
~Inner wheel is a sun. Along its left, at the "8 o'clock" is the moon, along 
the right at the "4" is the star.

~The stars are aligned, the doorways are open. May God forgive me.
