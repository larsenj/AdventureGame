# AdventureGame

A small "choose your own adventure" style of game with a Lovecraftian theme. Created for a class assignment on the use of pointers and dynamic memory allocation, I also used some bit-shifting in tracking inventory/events because I wanted to try out the concept.

Run with the command line argument "hints" to get hints as you go along.
