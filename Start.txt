Do not judge me, for you were not there.

These events will haunt me until the end of my life, however mercifully short 
that may be. My companions and I came to this underground hell in pursuit of
rumors of a buried civilization largely unknown to the world. Some clay pottery
and primitive metal implements convinced us there was something to the rumors,
worthy of industrious academic story. I shall not bore you with the details of
how we finally found this place, nor of our journey into its bowels, and certainly
not of the things we found at its center. I will only venture to say that at one
point I ran. I am not ashamed to say it. I ran as fast as I could, scrambling in 
the dark to get away from what we found.

I can hear the echos of the screams of my friends. I can only pray their screams
do not last and that I can find a way out of here. Before me are three passageways
I can take:  
1 - North
2 - South
3 - East

Oh no... I'm back where I started! The screams has gone down in volumne, but this
only means that the horrors being inflicted upon my companions are almost over,
after which I know I will be sought after.
