The odd angles of the cavern, the grotesque fungal flora clinging to it sides, 
the sounds of hollow screams coming from everywhere at once... I cannot be 
certain, but I believe I have been here before...
~I look around, vainly searching for some meager hint as to the exit, yet all I 
see are stange colored mushrooms along the sides of what appears to be a cavern.
I try to convince myself that the sounds I hear in the distance are the product 
of geothermal drafts wafting through the caverns, and not the faint screams of 
things that were once human.
