I look around, and this seems to be a cave much like any of the others I have 
seen here, but one thing stands out: in the middle of the open area lies a raised 
shallow pool.
~I look into the fountain and see a series of coins at the bottom of the clear
water. One coin has a bright gold color, one is a shiny silver, and the last one
is a brownish copper. I cannot make out the design on the coins, though this is
perhaps for the best, as merely gazing upon them causes the back of my eyes to
hurt, and a head-splitting pounding in my skull.
1 - Pick up the copper coin
2 - Pick up the silver coin
3 - Pick up the gold coin
4 - Nothing good can come from this - leave the pool alone
~Looking once more into the pool, I see that the coins I had left behind are no
longer there. I put my hand in my pocket and feel the slight weight of the coin
I took - do I want to divest myself of this burden?
1 - Yes, throw it back.
2 - No, there may be some value to it yet.
~Looking around, I see four ways I can leave this eerie place...
1 - North
2 - South
3 - East
4 - West
5 - Stay
~Looking around, there are only two options for moving on from here...
1 - East
2 - South
3 - Stay
